            Hello! My name is Andrew Yu and I am a current student in the UW
            bootcamp course. Prior to this program I was a Bartender for the Din
            Tai Fung Restaurant company and a small time Twitch streamer (Link
            below). I have been in customer service for nearly 10 years now. And
            after so much time in this ive decided to make a career change with
            this program.
          </p>
          <p>
            It took some time and a bit of research for me to commit to this
            program but after this first week I must say that the curriculum is
            very well made and give us students so many tools to succeed! BEST
            OF LUCK TO ALL AND THROUGH COLLABORATION WE SHALL ACHIEVE
            GREATNESS!!
